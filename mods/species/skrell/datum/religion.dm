	name = "Xilar Qall"
	description = "Xilar Qall is the most common religion in Skrell space, though still vastly outnumbered by agnostics and atheists. It is essentially a codification \
	of many modern Skrellian cultural features blended with local pantheistic beliefs. This was formalized as religion by elements of the Qerr-Katish in some \
	colonies following the Kaliâ€™r war, in an attempt to both minimize strife and enforce discipline and progress in Skrellian society."
